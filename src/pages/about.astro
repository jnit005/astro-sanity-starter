      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>When we began our journey, we noticed a significant gap between the mindset of fresh college graduates and the skills demanded by the industry. While graduates possessed strong technical and theoretical knowledge, they often lacked the essential soft skills needed to thrive in today’s workplace.</p>
      <p>Our mission was to bridge this gap by providing deep, industry-relevant insights. We gathered data from organizations across various sectors and developed world-class training materials tailored to meet modern business needs.</p>
      <p>Unlike many traditional soft skills training programs, which are outdated and misaligned with today’s fast-paced corporate environment, our approach is dynamic, practical, and future-focused.</p>
      <p>After years of research and collaboration, we founded INSMOT—a platform dedicated to equipping professionals with the critical skills needed for success, benefiting both individuals and the industries they serve.</p>
